TLDR: *Android and Me* is a blog from a System Administrator's perspective while running two seperate Android Pixel devices, one open source (running [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) the other running rooted "stock" Android 13 by Google.

This is the introduction post, but also will have some important information and links included.

Hi! I'm Caleb (@cfultz) and I have loved Android since I first used it back in the Eclair days on a T-Mobile G1 that I unlocked to place on AT&T to replace my iPhone 3G! It was then that I wanted to learn all I could about modifying, customizing, and protecting the Android ecosystem. 

Check out the [about page]({{ 'about' | relative_url }}) for the full story behind all that. But to speed this simple introduction up, this blog will hopefully show the differences that I enjoy between using my Pixel 6a using [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) as well as my Pixel 7 Pro with rooted (by [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)) Android 13
