TLDR: Nerd that loves Android runs two phones, different OSes, one non-Google, one Google powered to see if there is a true difference and if he can utilize open source alternatives on one while using "*normal*" apps on the other.

## Hi!

![Caleb](https://media.cfultz.com/accounts/avatars/109/408/251/484/750/392/original/ac0f15348a4c59f4.jpg)

Hello there! I'm Caleb ([@cfultz](https://github.com/cfultz), I'm a Linux System Administrator III for the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://info.nrao.edu), and I love Android! I have ever since I first purchased a T-Mobile [G1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream), rooted it to unlock it, and made it work on AT&T to replace my [iPhone 3G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3G) which was my first jump into rooting through the jailbreaking procedures. 


## I used to be cool

I have created several applications that I released on the Play Store and garnered several thousand downloads. Sadly, they are no longer available as I haven't been doing any sort of Android development for around 3 years. I worked on the [Android App Addicts](https://podnutz.com/category/android-app-addicts/) application and even appeared on a few episodes early on. 


## Work History and such

I owned and operated nTelosDroid.com, a website dedicated to the rooting and romming of Android devices on the regional carrier nTelos. This landed me a job in their techincal support department thanks to the massive user base I had cultivated by troubleshooting through the forums. I closed that website in late 2013 due to *conflict of interests*, moved into the Data Operations team at nTelos until they were purchased in 2016. After a few years doing network operations for another local company, I joined the National Radio Astronomy Observatory as a Linux System Administrator and that's where I am to this day.

## What does all that have to do with Android and Me? 

Nothing really. I wanted to let you know who you were reading posts by sooooo :D

## So, what is Android and Me?!

This blog will be about my venture into using two Pixels, one a 6a running [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/), the other a rooted "stock" 7 Pro. 

### First, what is CalyxOS?

![CalyxOS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Calyxos_Logo_CalyxOS_Dark.svg/2560px-Calyxos_Logo_CalyxOS_Dark.svg.png)

A completely Google-free, privacy focused ROM built *mostly* for Pixel devices. While it runs on a few other phones, Pixels are their primary build targets. CalyxOS uses [microG](https://microg.org/) in order to interface with certain things that you might want to use from the [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore), but there is nothing Google on there.

### And why rooted?

I haven't rooted anything in forever because I was locked into Verizon devices with locked bootloaders. I said "**NO MORE!!!**" and purchased a Pixel 7 Pro from Google and joined [Google Fi](https://g.co/fi/r/JDN1V2) (referal link). I rooted the stock Android 13 OS using [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) and have modified a few things, but nothing too crazy. 

## Okay, so what is Android and Me about?!

I will be running two phones, with different OSes, one non-Google, one Google powered to see if there is a true difference and if I can utilize open source alternatives on one while using "*normal*" apps on the other. I will post the findings, wins, losses, utter failures, and dumb luck on this blog. I hope that you join me on this ride!
